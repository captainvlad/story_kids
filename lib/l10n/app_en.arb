For example, snakes! Or hairy spiders! Or aliens with pink eyes and hairy teeth! Soon friends discover that sometimes fear is not as ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù as it seems at first - and is even perfectly normal. With cute illustrations and fun dialogues, 'I'm (Not) Afraid' is sure to become a favorite storytelling for the whole family! In this interesting story that causes a smile, about how to (not) be afraid, we meet characters from the story '(You are not) small' by the winner of Theodor Seuss Geisel Award. 'I'm (Not) Afraid' is a short story written by Anna Kang, illustrated by Christopher Weyant and published by Two Lions. Keep an eye out for other books in the fun (Un) series coming soon to Vooks!",
